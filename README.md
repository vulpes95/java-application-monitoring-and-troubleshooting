### What do any application doing?
[System as Public service Metaphor](/visuals/restoran-as-system-metaphor.jpg)

| Concept | Metaphor | Code
|---------|----------|-----
| Thread | **Worker man** | Thread created by runtime: `java MyApplication` 
| Data input | **Visitor's wishes** | [Console user input](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Presentation.java#L31)
| Data processing | **Meal recipes, conversation scripts, labor instructions** | [Code as instructions](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Controller.java) 
| Data storing | **Persistent production store** | [Files as persistent store](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/ClientRepository.java)
| Data output | **Giving away to Visitor his meals** | [Console output](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Presentation.java#L33)

### How we do model the data?
| Concept | Metaphor | Code
|---------|----------|-----
| Primitive Types | People can think and communicate only with **numbers and strings** | [String restaurant menu](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Presentation.java#L32)
| Structures | People can think with composite entities, **concepts** | [Domain class and enum](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Client.java)
| Object of structure | **Instance** of concept, with its own state differs from other instance | [Dealing with particular object while processing request](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Service.java) 

### How we do model the behavior?
| Concept | Metaphor | Code
|---------|----------|-----
| Procedure | Meal **recipe** or conversation **script** | [Setting behavior with methods](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Presentation.java#L30)
| Call stack | **Chain of actions** workers call at others  | [Calling method from method](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Presentation.java#L12)
| Class | **Role**: Chief or Waiter, state + bunch of procedures dealing with it | Today we likely divide state and behavior to [domain entities](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Client.java) and [services](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Service.java)
| Object of class | **Johnny the Chief** and **Maggy the chief** differs with its state but have same behavior |  
| Application logic | Scenario how to behave all the workers in any case | [Workers takes responsibilities on them to rule at their level](/src/main/java/com/acme/dbo/Controller.java)

### Where data is stored? Core data scopes
| Concept | Metaphor | Implementation
|---------|----------|---------------
| Local/method/stack variables | Short-term memory: Chief remember sugar doze only when doing sugaring | Call Stack   
| Parameters | Details when asking others to do some work: waiter asks johnnyChief.makeMeal(whatMeals?) | Call Stack 
| Object state | State of worker or structure: its current properties values | Heap object space
| - Request scope | Some object state accessible to all the workers in call chain handling request: sticky note or voice message given each worker to next, "not spicy" | Parameters, framework support, ThreadLocal  
| - Session scope | Some object state accessible to all the workers handling all requests from the same Visitor: "its for table 13" | Framework support
| - Singleton/application scope | Some object state accessible to all the workers | Framework support, Language support for static variables
| Persistent | Long-term data store surviving system restarts | File, embedded/local database, remote filesystem, remote database
| Integration | Data stored and processed by external system | Remote system procedure call, message queue

### How do we implement application with Java
| Concept | Metaphor | Reality
|---------|----------|--------
| Runtime | If Developer is CEO setting application logic, Runtime is your vice | JVM API and system library API
| Working with _thread_: Thread API, states, pooling | We can create work force on demand to execute our instructions | But we have some RAM memory and performance cost 
| Working with _class_: dynamic classloading | Instructions what to do workers get just in time not ahead but worker remember it till die | But we have run-time latency costs
| Working with _instance_: create and GC | We ask our vice to hire and retire workers | Objects state costs us RAM memory. When object's no longer needed it purged from RAM

### [Teamwork](#teamwork-nfrs-and-metrics-checklist-15m)

### How do we build Java application?
- [ ] JVM vs JRE vs JDK
- [ ] Phisical point ov view for java application
- [ ] Classes, packages and JARs
- [ ] classpath x2
- [ ] Build cycle raw
- [ ] Build cycle with Maven
### How do we run Java application?
- [ ] JVM vs JRE vs JDK
- [ ] Run with JVM
- [ ] Ways for application run-time parameterization: jvm parameters, program arguments, sys/app properties
- [ ] Key JVM parameters for memory setup
### How do we monitor Java application internals?
- [ ] JMX simple tooling demo: JVisualVM
- [ ] JMX architecture overview

### [Hands-on](#hands-on-simple-application-local-building-running-and-monitoring-30m)

## Teamwork: NFRs and metrics checklist (15m)
- [ ] What Quality Attributes/NFRs does JVM provide for application?
- [ ] What Quality Attributes/NFRs do we satisfy with application monitoring?
- [ ] Start metrics [checklist](METRICS-CHECKLIST.md) by tier: JVM metrics

## Hands-on: Simple application _local_ building, running and monitoring (30m)
### Given
- [ ] Satisfied [prerequisites](#Prerequisites) 
- [ ] **Forked** simple project [codebase](https://github.com/eugene-krivosheyev/java-application-monitoring-and-troubleshooting) 
- [ ] Cloned fork locally
```shell script
cd
git clone https://github.com/{{ STUDENT_ACCOUNT }}/java-application-monitoring-and-troubleshooting
cd java-application-monitoring-and-troubleshooting
git checkout {{ group_custom_branch }}
```
### When
- [ ] Project application built locally with maven
```shell script
mvn clean verify [-DskipTests]
```
- [ ] Project application ran locally with CLI
```shell script
java \
  -Xms128m -Xmx256m \
  -cp target/dbo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
  -Dapp.property=value \
  com.acme.dbo.Presentation \
  program arguments
```
- [ ] JVisualVM profiler connected to running app
```shell script
$JAVA_HOME/bin/jvisualvm
```
- [ ] OS-specific monitoring tool shows application process details
```shell script
linux$ top [-pid jvmpid]
windows> taskmgr
```
### Then answered and reviewed at debrief
- [ ] What is the default encoding for I/O?
- [ ] What is the default heap size for app running?
- [ ] How many java threads is active within JVM? 
- [ ] How many OS threads is active within OS JVM process? 
- [ ] What is the minimal possible heap size for app running?
- [x] What is the difference for profiler times: Self time/Total time, CPU time?

### Monitoring overview and tools
### Load generation architecture overview
- [ ] Types of performance testing except stress testing?
- [ ] While monitoring: What type should we use? What performance metrics do we test?
- [ ] Testing vs Monitoring

## Hands-on: Prod host and monitoring provisioning (15m)
### Given
- [ ] Ansible provisioning [scripts and assets](/iaac) 
```shell script
cd iaac
``` 
- [ ] Provisioning [documentation](/iaac/README.md)

### When
- [ ] Steps executed according Provisioning documentation

### Then
- [ ] Prometheus UI up and running at `http://{{ prod }}:9090/alerts`
- [x] JMeter can connect agent deployed at {{ prod }}:
```shell script
jmeter -Jremote_hosts=127.0.0.1 -Dserver.rmi.ssl.disable=true

JMeter → Options → Log Viewer
JMeter → Run → Remote Start → 127.0.0.1
```

top
top + 'f'
top -p <pid>
top -H -p <pid>

http://{{ prod }}:9090/graph?g0.range_input=15m&g0.tab=0&g0.expr=http_server_requests_seconds_count
```

### Finally
- [ ] JMeter load emulation stopped at dev station
- [ ] Application gracefully stopped at {{ prod }}
```shell script
curl --request POST http://{{ prod }}:8080/dbo/actuator/shutdown

- [x] How many Docker containers are running? What images used?
- [ ] What are the `health` indicator for application?
- [ ] What is the application uptime?
- [ ] What is the CPU usage for application?
- [ ] How many http requests servlet container handled by different URLs? 
- [ ] How many http sessions are active?
- [ ] What is the current `system load average`?
